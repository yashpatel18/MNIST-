# MNIST-

Here I have used the classic MNIST handwritten digit dataset. I have built a model using tensorflow to predict the handwritten digit. I achevied the accuracy of around 98% on test data.

Here's a README file template specifically for your `MNIST.ipynb` notebook. This template is structured to help you document your image classification project clearly.

## README Template: MNIST Image Classification

### Project Title

**MNIST Digit Classification using [Specify Your Model Here, e.g., Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Multi-layer Perceptron]**

### Description

This project focuses on building and evaluating a machine learning model for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset for image classification tasks, consisting of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). This notebook demonstrates the process from data loading and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and prediction.

### Project Structure

This repository contains the following Jupyter notebook:

  * `MNIST.ipynb`: This notebook covers the entire workflow for the MNIST digit classification task, including data loading, preprocessing (e.g., normalization, reshaping), defining and compiling the model, training the model, evaluating its performance, and visualizing predictions.

### Installation

To run this notebook, you'll need to have Python installed along with the following libraries. You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib tensorflow keras scikit-learn
```

(Note: If you're using a different deep learning framework like PyTorch, adjust `tensorflow` and `keras` accordingly.)

### Usage

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
2.  **Open the notebook:**
    Launch Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook from the project root directory:
    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    # or
    jupyter notebook
    ```
3.  **Run the cells:**
    Execute all cells in the `MNIST.ipynb` notebook sequentially. The notebook will download the MNIST dataset automatically (if not already present), train the model, and display performance metrics and example predictions.

### Dataset

The MNIST dataset is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. It consists of:

  * **Training Set:** 60,000 examples
  * **Test Set:** 10,000 examples
  * Each image is a 28x28 pixel grayscale image.
  * The dataset is directly available through deep learning libraries like Keras/TensorFlow.

### Model Architecture

[Describe the architecture of the model you used in `MNIST.ipynb` here. For example:]

  * **Type:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
  * **Layers:**
      * Convolutional layers with ReLU activation.
      * Pooling layers (e.g., MaxPooling).
      * Flatten layer.
      * Dense (fully connected) layers.
      * Output layer with 10 units (for 10 digits) and softmax activation.
  * **Optimizer:** [e.g., Adam]
  * **Loss Function:** [e.g., Sparse Categorical Crossentropy]

### Results

[This section will be populated after you run your notebook and analyze the results.]

  * **Accuracy:** [State the final test accuracy, e.g., "The model achieved a test accuracy of X%." ]
  * **Loss:** [State the final test loss.]
  * **Confusion Matrix:** [You might mention if a confusion matrix was generated and any insights from it.]
  * **Example Predictions:** [Describe or show examples of correctly and incorrectly classified digits.]
  * **Key Findings:** [Summarize any insights, e.g., "The CNN model effectively learned features for digit recognition," "Certain digits (e.g., 5s and 8s) were more challenging to classify."]

### Contributing

1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`).
3.  Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`).
4.  Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`).
5.  Open a Pull Request.

### How to use this template:

1.  **Replace Placeholders:** Go through the template and fill in all the bracketed `[ ]` information with specifics from your `MNIST.ipynb` project.
2.  **Create `README.md`:** If you're setting up a GitHub repository, create a file named `README.md` (case-sensitive) in the root of your project and paste this content into it.
3.  **Run and Populate:** Execute your `MNIST.ipynb` notebook to get the performance metrics and results, then update the "Results" section accordingly.

Let me know once you've set this up, and then we can discuss how to approach modularizing your code, either for this MNIST project or your previous time series notebooks\!
